# My_Calculator1


Here's my first way of writing a code for creating a calculator

This calculator adds only two numbers which was created using user defined functions...

Four operations can be done with this calculator...Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

# calculator_100days_1

Here explains how I wrote a code for addition of two numbers using conditionals & the while loop

It also contains a dictionary which links the user's input of the operation, conditionals with the functions

Might look a bit much but my #calculator_100days_2 eliminates some lines of code

#My calculator_100days_2

Here explains how I wrote my code without using a dictionary but a tuple just to show the user the operations for the calculator

I also used conditionals which shows directly links to the calling of the functions

Some lines of codes from #calculator_100days_1 were erased 

Upcoming #calculator_100days_3 will come with a better taste as I improve myself as also courtesy of my #100days of code class with Dr.Angela Yu


Finally....


Enjoy the codes and I'll have to have your comments on how i can improve this mini-project of mine...
