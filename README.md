Here's my first way of writing a code for creating a calculator

This calculator adds only two numbers which was created using user defined functions...

Four operations can be done with this calculator...Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

There's another way i'm going to write the codes of my calculator using conditionals and another without using conditionals...

Enjoy the codes and I'll have to have your comments on how i can improve this mini-project of mine...
